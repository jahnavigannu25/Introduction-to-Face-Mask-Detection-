# Introduction-to-Face-Mask-Detection-
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of wearing face masks in public places to prevent the spread of the virus. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to design and implement a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to identify individuals wearing masks in real-time.

This project proposes a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to identify
individuals wearing masks in real-time. The system utilizes a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to classify images of faces as either masked or unmasked. The proposed system
achieves an accuracy of 96.5% on a dataset of 1376 images, demonstrating its effectiveness
in detecting face masks.

The face mask detection system consists of the following components:
1. Data Collection: A dataset of images of faces with and without masks was
collected from various sources.

2. Data Preprocessing: The images were resized, normalized, and augmented to
increase the dataset size and improve model performance.

3. Model Development: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and
trained using the preprocessed dataset. The CNN consists of several convolutional and
pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on a test dataset, achieving an
accuracy of 96.5%.

5. Real-time Implementation: The trained model was integrated with a webcam to
detect face masks in real-time.
