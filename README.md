# Introduction-to-Face-Mask-Detection-
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of wearing face masks in public places to prevent the spread of the virus. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to design and implement a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to identify individuals wearing masks in real-time.
This project proposes a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to identify
individuals wearing masks in real-time. The system utilizes a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to classify images of faces as either masked or unmasked. The proposed system
achieves an accuracy of 96.5% on a dataset of 1376 images, demonstrating its effectiveness
in detecting face masks.
