# Introduction-to-Face-Mask-Detection-
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of wearing face masks in public places to prevent the spread of the virus. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to design and implement a face mask detection system using deep learning techniques to identify individuals wearing masks in real-time.
